# ZONZA Engineering Center

## What is this?
This repository contains public information about technical aspects of [ZONZA
(http://zonza.tv)](http://zonza.tv) for its clients and also showcases our
Open Source contributions.

The site is served using Jekyll/[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
can be viewed at http://zonza.github.io

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Once merged into the
master branch, Github will compile and servce the site automatically for us!
:thumbsup:

Find out how to get started by reading the [Github Pages Jekyll
documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
Please test locally before pushing!

## How to install/run/test

```
bundle install
./runserver.sh
```
...then fire up [http://localhost:4000](). Any changes you make will be recompiled automatically by the Jekyll server. Simply refresh your browser to see the updates.

## Why is this on Github?
It makes sense for documentation to live alongside the code it is documenting
and since we're already users of Github, it's familiar. It's also another way
of us being a part of the thriving Open Source communitity on Github and being
more open with our customers.
